## The plan for this session

Now we have worked through some preliminaries, we'll move on to some more interesting content, seeing how people have used online data collection to answer linguistic questions and playing with code to allow us to do the same.

We'll start by looking at a paper of Bodo's on co-speech gesture and mental timelines - this is very much *not* my area, but the experimental paradigm he uses is nice and simple, so coding it up is going to be a good place to start (and hopefully useful for Bodo). After some preliminary remarks, I'll give a quick summary of what Experiment 1 in this paper was about and what it looks like, then in [the accompanying practical](practical_session1a.md) you'll get a chance to look at some very simple jsPsych code to implement something similar.

## The paper 

- [Winter, B., & Duffy, S. E. (2020). Can Co-Speech Gestures Alone Carry the Mental Time Line?
*Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 46,* 1768-1781.](http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/96040354/winter_duffy_gesture_timeline_revisions_complete.pdf)
